# balance-source
Source code for my game Balance, https://abysssal.itch.io/balance

My code is not the prettiest, so if you have any type of respect for yourself, I would recommend not to open a file here. Most of the code is messy and I usually don't write comments, simply because I think they dont really serve any purpose.

Also should say that the code is in Unity C# working with 2D physics. The game is physics based, and thats part of the reason the enemies will fly backwards if you shoot them enough.
