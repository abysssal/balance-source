Source code for my game Balance, https://abysssal.itch.io/balance

My code is not the prettiest and the fact that this was made for a game jam makes the code worse, so if you have any type of respect for yourself, I would recommend not to open a file here. Most of the code is messy and I usually don't write comments, simply because I think they dont really serve any purpose.

Also should say that the code is in Unity C# working with 2D physics. The game is physics based, and thats part of the reason the enemies will fly backwards if you shoot them enough, because they have no linear drag. Also this code is for the most recent version of the game, 1.01, so the game jam code looks slightly different.

Enjoy my terrible code!
